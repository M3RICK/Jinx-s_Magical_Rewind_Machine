# What RiftRewind Does

RiftRewind offers two main experiences, each designed to help you improve in different ways:

## Core Features Overview

### 1. Ignite the Rewind - Interactive Map Analysis

Navigate an interactive Summoner's Rift map with clickable icons at each lane and objective. Get specific, targeted feedback on:

- **Lane Performance** - How you're doing in Top, Mid, Bot, Jungle, or Support
- **Objective Control** - Your Dragon and Baron play
- **Map Awareness** - Positioning and roaming patterns

The feedback adjusts based on your selected mode (Roast or Coach), giving you either constructive criticism or entertaining roasts while still teaching you what matters.

### 2. Player Cards - Shareable Achievement System

After your analysis, receive a AI customised designed player card featuring:

- Your summoner level and rank
- A custom player title based on your playstyle
- Your most-played champion as the background
- A personalized description categorizing your gameplay style

Share your card with friends and show off your unique identity as a player.

### 3. Vi's Direct Coaching - Personalized AI Assistant

Chat directly with your personal AI coach, who has:

- **Complete League Knowledge** - Every champion, item, rune, and mechanic (synced to the latest patch)
- **Your Personal Data** - Recent match history and performance stats
- **Persistent Memory** - Remembers your previous coaching sessions
- **Contextual Awareness** - Sees your last 20 games while you chat

Our AI provides personalized advice tailored to your specific questions, playstyle, and history.

## Two Modes, One Goal

Choose your experience:

- **Classical Mode** - Professional, constructive feedback focused on improvement
- **Roast Mode** - Brutal honesty with humor, making your mistakes entertaining while still educational

Both modes provide the same quality insights, just with different tones to match your preference.
