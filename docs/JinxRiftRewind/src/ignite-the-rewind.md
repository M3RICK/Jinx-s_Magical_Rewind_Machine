# Ignite the Rewind

**Interactive Map-Based Feedback System**

## Overview

Ignite the Rewind transforms your match data into an interactive visual experience. Instead of scrolling through tables of statistics, you explore Summoner's Rift itself, clicking on specific areas to get targeted feedback.

## How It Works

### 1. Map Navigation

After entering your summoner information and selecting your mode, you're presented with an interactive map of Summoner's Rift. The map features clickable icons at strategic locations:

- **Top Lane**
- **Mid Lane**
- **Bottom Lane**
- **Jungle**
- **Dragon Pit**
- **Baron Nashor**
- **River**

### 2. Click for Insights

Click on any icon to receive specific feedback about your performance in that area. The AI analyzes your recent matches and provides:

- Strengths
- Common mistakes or weaknesses
- Actionable tips for improvement

### 3. Mode-Specific Feedback

The tone and severity of the criticism adapt based on your selected mode:

**Classical Mode:**
- Professional, encouraging tone
- Constructive criticism with clear explanations
- Focus on gradual improvement

**Roast Mode:**
- Humorous, brutally honest commentary
- Still educational, but delivered with entertainment value
- Makes learning from mistakes more enjoyable (for masochists)

### 4. Camera Controls

Navigate the map smoothly:
- **Mouse Movement** - Move around the map naturally by approaching your mouse to each 4 corners of the screen (Wow just like in your favorite game)
- **Smooth Camera** - Improved camera movement for better UX

## Technical Features

- Real-time feedback generation based on player data
- Responsive interactive elements
- Smooth animations and transitions

## What Makes It Special

Unlike static stat pages, Ignite the Rewind makes you think about the map spatially. You're not just reading "died too much" - you're seeing WHERE on the map you struggle and getting context-specific advice for those areas.
