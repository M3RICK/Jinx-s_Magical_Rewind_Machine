# The Problem We're Solving

## The Current State of League Improvement Tools

League of Legends is a complex game with a steep learning curve. Players wanting to improve face several challenges:

### 1. Data Overload Without Context

Existing platforms like OP.GG and DMP.LOL provide extensive statistics: win rates, KDA, CS per minute, damage dealt... But they don't tell you **why** you're losing or **how** to improve. Players are left staring at numbers without actionable guidance.

### 2. Generic Advice

Most improvement resources offer one-size-fits-all advice. "Ward more," "CS better," "Don't die" these tips apply to everyone but help no one specifically.

### 3. Lack of Personalization

Your playstyle is unique. You have favorite champions, preferred roles, preferred item builds and specific strengths and weaknesses. But current tools treat every player the same way.

### 4. No Memory or Progress Tracking

When you work with a human coach, they remember your previous sessions and can track your growth over time. Existing AI tools start fresh every conversation, losing valuable context.
