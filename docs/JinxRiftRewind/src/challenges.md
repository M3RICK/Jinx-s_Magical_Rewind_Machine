# Challenges & Learnings

**What We Learned Building RiftRewind**

## Thierry B. - Backend & Cloud Infrastructure

### Key Learnings

**AWS Ecosystem:**
Learning about AWS services in depth was eye-opening. Setting up Elastic Beanstalk, DynamoDB, and Bedrock integration taught me how powerful cloud infrastructure can be when properly configured. The managed services approach significantly reduced operational overhead.

**AI Integration with LangChain:**
I never knew AI integrations could be so simple. LangChain's abstraction layer made it incredibly straightforward to connect Claude to our application, implement tool calling, and manage conversation history. It made me wonder why more websites don't leverage AI in their user experiences, the barrier to entry is much lower than I expected.

**SQL vs SQLite:**
This hackathon was my first real experience understanding the difference between traditional SQL databases and SQLite. I wanted to try the dual-database approach (SQLite for static data, DynamoDB for dynamic) to optimize performance and reduce API calls. The result was fewer network requests and faster query times for game data.

### Biggest Challenges

**Architecture Management:**
My hardest challenge was staying level-headed throughout development. As you can tell from the codebase, the architecture is a mess and really unoptimized. It was incredibly difficult remembering where everything was and how components interconnected. That's mainly my own fault, in the rush to build features, proper documentation and organization fell by the wayside.

**Time Constraints:**
Our second major challenge was the timeframe. We couldn't work much on the project during the whole hackathon period - we only had this last week or so to really put in the work. Balancing school projects alongside the hackathon was extremely difficult, and it showed in our rushed implementation and lack of testing infrastructure.
